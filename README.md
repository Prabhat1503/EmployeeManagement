# Employee Management and Salary System

## Overview

The Employee Management and Salary System is a command-line application built using Node.js. This program allows you to manage employee records and calculate monthly salaries based on hours worked and hourly rates. This README file provides an overview of the application's features and how to use it.

## Features

1. **Add Employee**: Add new employees to the system by providing their name and employee ID. Employee data is saved to a JSON file for future reference.

2. **View Employees**: Display a list of all employees in the system, including their names and IDs.

3. **Calculate Employee Salary**: Calculate the monthly salary for an employee based on the number of hours worked and their hourly rate. The system deducts a 20% tax from the gross salary to calculate the net salary.

4. **Save Employee Data**: Employee data is automatically saved to a JSON file (`employeeData.json`) after each addition, ensuring that data is not lost.


## Usage

Once you have started the application, you will be presented with the main menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various tasks:

1. **Add Employee**: Enter the employee's name and ID to add them to the system.

2. **View Employees**: View a list of all employees currently in the system.

3. **Calculate Employee Salary**: Calculate the monthly salary for an employee by providing the number of hours worked and their hourly rate.
4. **Output** Output of the code "employeeManagement.js"
